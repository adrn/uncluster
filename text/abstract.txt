The properties of the initial population of globular clusters around Milky
Way-like galaxies are still unknown. Recent work has suggested that the Milky
Way initially hosted close to 10,000 globular clusters, the vast majority of
which have disrupted and contributed a significant fraction of the mass of the
stellar halo and bulge. This would have profound implications for the chemical
and dynamical structure of both the bulge and the stellar halo of our Galaxy. We
consider several scenarios for the kinematics and mass distribution of the
initial clusters and predict for each (1) the number of observable thin stellar
streams today, (2) the clustering in conserved kinematic quantities, and (3) the
fraction of the mass of the stellar halo contributed by disrupted globular
clusters. We will discuss how to test these predictions with kinematic
measurements from the Gaia mission, deep photometry from the LSST and WFIRST,
and planned, large-area spectroscopic surveys.
